        <h3>These easy baked chicken thighs require minimum preparation</h3>

        <p>This is a quick recipe.</p>
        <p>I like to use cayenne powder and black pepper.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>4 chicken thighs</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons onion flakes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place chicken thighs in a baking dish; season both sides with garlic powder and onion flakes.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
